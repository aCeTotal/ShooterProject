# ShooterProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 4 4.26

I started a while ago on a First Person project, which I have not had the opportunity to continue with.

This can be a good starting point for someone who wants to create an FPS from scratch. Make sure you choose the branch with the latest changes. I was not completely finished with the stuff I was working on, so this was never put on the master.
